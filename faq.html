        <h4 class="question">Why are you getting married on two days?</h4>
        <p class="answer">September 26th is a very meaningful date in our relationship. It is the day we went on our first date, the day we got together, and the day we got engaged. We want that to be the day we get married as well. Due to our timing constraints, finding a venue to do the entire wedding at on September 26th proved challenging. So we got creative and decided to split it up onto two days.<br><br>September 26th will be the day of our ceremony, something we are holding for a smaller set of guests. September 27th will be our reception, the day we cut the cake, have our first dance, and celebrate with all our friends and family. </p>
