        <h4 class="question" id="twoDays">Why are you getting married on two days?</h4>
        <p class="answer">September 26th has been the date of record in our relationship. It was the day we had our first date, the day we became "official", and the day we got engaged. So in order to make Travis only remember one date, we wanted to get married on that day as well. Austin being the popular place that it is, we couldn't find a venue that we loved and that was large enough to hold all of our friends and family on the 26th.
        <br>
        <br>
        So, what we decided to do was have a small, intimate, family ceremony on the 26th at a family friends home. Then, we are going to extend the party into Sunday, September 27th for our reception with all our family and friends.
        <br>
        <br>
        We plan to do all the major moments, besides the vows, at the reception. So be prepared for the first dance, cake cutting, the bridal polka, bouqet toss, and plenty of dancing on Sunday night.
        </p>

        <p class="answer">Our reception will run until roughly 10:30pm on Sunday night with an open bar all night.

        <h4 class="question">What is the bridal polka?</h4>
        <p class="answer">The Bridal Polka is a Western Pennsylvania (where Ashley's family is from) wedding tradition. During the Bridal Polka, all of the guests at the wedding line up to dance with the bride to polka music. Traditionally guests donate a small amount of money to the Honeymoon Fund in exchange for a shot of alcohol (if they want it) and the opportunity to briefly dance with the bride. After dancing with the bride, they join the growing crowd of people encircling the bride.
          <br>
          <br>
          After all the guests have danced with the bride, the circle collapses in on the bride and the groom, with the help of his groomsmen, tries to break through the crowd to get the bride. The groom eventually reaches his bride and carries her away.</p>

        <!-- <h4 class="question">Will your last name and address be changing after the wedding?</h4>
        <p class="answer">Yes, Ashley will become Mrs. Favaron and we will be getting a new address. For that address, please contact us through the contact page and we will happily share it with you!</p> -->
